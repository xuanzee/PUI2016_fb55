# Null hypothesis exercise

### Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise? 

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

*Experiment*: placing a test sample of N people and a control sample of M people under a diet and a control exercise regime respectively for a period of time T . Each group's weight lost $Wl$ is measured as the average of the weight loss of each individual in each group at the end of the experiment (at time T). The average weight loss is 
$\bar{WL_\mathrm{diet}} $ and for the test and 
$\bar{WL_\mathrm{exercise}} $ for the control sample.

*Null*: The test sample (on a diet) has lost on average less or the same amount of weight than the control sample (on an exercise regime)

*Alternative*: The test sample has lost on average mor weight than the control sample

$H_0$ : $\bar{WL_\mathrm{diet}} - \bar{WL_\mathrm{exercise}} <= 0 $

$H_a$ : $\bar{WL_\mathrm{diet}} - \bar{WL_\mathrm{exercise}} > 0 $

**Do American trust the president?**

POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23).
Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

*Null*: The fraction of adults that trust Bill Clinton $P_\mathrm{Trust}$ is grater or equal than the fraction of adults that do not trust him $P_\mathrm{noTrust}$

*Alternative*:  The fraction of adults that trust Bill Clinton ($P_\mathrm{Trust}$) is smaller than the fraction of adults that do not trust him ($P_\mathrm{noTrust}$)

$H_0$ : $P_\mathrm{Trust} - P_\mathrm{noTrust} >= 0 $

$H_a$ : $P_\mathrm{Trust} - P_\mathrm{noTrust} < 0 $

(notice: in this case it is not clear whether the alternative should be that he is trusted or not, so a negative null (distrust) would also be accepted)

**Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.**
*Experiment*: Smokers are smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch for a time T. Cessation rates (fraction of smokers that quit smoking) is measured for both groups:
$Rstop_test$, $Rstop_control$.

*Null*: The test sample (on nicotine patch) has a lower than or equal cessation rate to the control sample (on placebo patch)

*Alternative*: The test sample has a higher cessation rate than the control sample

$H_0$ : $Rstop_test - Rstop_control <= 0 $

$H_a$ : $Rstop_test - Rstop_control > 0 $

**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.**

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

This could be done in many ways. The level of smoking can be quantified in a continuous scale, or in categorical variables. A longitudinal study could measure the developemental rate. But the simplest thing is to simply measure the IQ of the 2 groups averaged over the 4 ages. Let's assume there is a test (smoking pregnant women) and a control sample (non-smoking pregnant women)

*Experiment*: The IQ of children in a test (smoking pregnant mother) and a control sample (non-smoking pregnant mother) is measured for each chiled at 4 ages (1,2,3 and 4 yo). The average IQ of the test ($\bar{IQ_\mathrm{smoker}}$) and of the control sample ($\bar{IQ_\mathrm{non-smoker}}$) are considered.

*Null*: The average IQ of children in a test sample of children of smoking mothers (smoking qhile pregnant) is greater or equal, when measured over 4 years in annual intervals, to the IQ of a control sample of children of non-smoking mothers.

*Alternative*: The average IQ of children in a test sample of children of smoking mothers (smoking qhile pregnant) is lower, when measured over 4 years in annual intervals, than the IQ of a control sample of children of non-smoking mothers.

$H_0$ : $\bar{IQ_\mathrm{smoker}} - \bar{IQ_\mathrm{non-smoker}} >= 0 $

$H_a$ : $\bar{IQ_\mathrm{smoker}} - \bar{IQ_\mathrm{non-smoker}} < 0 $
