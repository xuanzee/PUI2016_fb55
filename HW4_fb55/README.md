# PUI2016 HW 3.

## ASSIGNED READING:

[Estimating the Reproducibility of Social Sciences](www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716.full.pdf) Open Science Collaboration, 2015

This is a seminal paper that initiated a number of efforts to increase reproducibility and support open science (e.g. the [COS](https://centerforopenscience.org/))

How to read a scientific paper: you do not need to read all of it (generally scientists don't unless the paper is directly connected with their research.)
On a journal like science the front page of the articleis a synapsis of it. Read that (mandatory). Then go to the body of the article and read:
Abstract (mandatory), Introduction (you can skip it if you think the front page gave you sufficient understanding), 
Tables and Tables caption (mandatory), Figures and Figure captions (mandatory), Conclusions (mandatory). 
_You are responsible for reading **and understanding** the content of the reading material_. If anything is not clear, because of language difficulties or any other reason, please ask!

## ASSIGNMENTS:

### Submission Info:

For Assignment 1: work alone. 

For Assignment 2: work in groups of 2. Strictly no more than 3!

For the rest of the HW you can work in groups, and you are encouraged to. 
Create a HW4_\<netID\> directory in your PUI2016_\<netID\> repository. 
Include a README.md that briefly summarizes the scope of the homework (so we know you understand what you did), 
and states with whome you worked and what you specifically contributed to. 

Submit __Assignment 1__ as a pull request markdown file to be added to your classmate repository (see below), 

Submit __Assignment 2__ by including your 2 tables (see below) in the README for the directory 
and Assignment 3 by pushing the notebooks into your PUI2016_\<netID\>/HW4_\<netID\> repository. 
Keep in mind that we will look for possible cases of plagiarism, 
and if the code appears too similar to that of people that you did not work with to be original work 

(there are automated ways to look for plagiarism in code) you will be penalized.

### Assignment 1: Review your classmate's Citibike project proposal

You will recieve an email tonight with the name, netid, and github username of a classmate. 

1. check that the class-mate is not already in your group and contact me promptly if they are! By lunch time tomorrow I want to do the necessary reassignments so that each of you is paired with a classmate.

2. look in the classmate HW3_\<netid\> repo ASAP and identify their submission for the citibike project.

3. Fork their repository, and clone it (you did this in HW1, look at the instructions in  the HW1 [README](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2016_fb55/blob/master/HW1_fb55/README.md) if you need to refresh your memory)

4. Read it carefully (but do not modify the notebook)! You have to:
  
  a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly
  
  b. verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test was not chosen yet)
  
  c. CHOOSE A TEST THAT WOULD BE SUITABLE TO TEST THE NULL HYPOTHESIS $H_0$ given the type of data, and the question asked. 
  You can refer to the slides flowchart of statistical tests for this, or to the CSU cheat-sheet [here](http://www.csun.edu/~amarenco/Fcs%20682/When%20to%20use%20what%20test.pdf)
  
5.  Write  your comments, suggestions, and suggested statistical test, motivating your test choice, in a markdown **named CitibikeReview_\<netID\>.ms**. 

6. Submit a pull request to the original repository.


### Grading: 

you will be graded on the validity and depth of your review. 50% of the grade will be on the feed back on the research proposal. Be thorrough (without being offensive of course with your feedback). 50% will be on the suggested test: if it is the incorrect test you will loose points. However, if you motivate rationally your choice, you may get partial credit even if the test is not the best choice. **Notice: I will be grading these assignments, not the TAs**. 



### Assignment 2: Literature choices of statistical tests

Work with one or maximum two more people. 

Choose two tests from the forst table in [A. Marengo CSU "When to use what test?" document](http://www.csun.edu/~amarenco/Fcs%20682/When%20to%20use%20what%20test.pdf), one in the top potrion of the chart (chi-sq, t-test, and the ANOVA family of tests) where you are looking for differences between groups, and one in the bottom portion where you are looking for relationships bewteen the dependent and independent variables (correlation, regression, path analysis).

Go to the main web page of the journal [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/) and search for articles that use that test (**DO NOT USE THE ARTICLE I USED FOR THE CLASS EXAMPLE:** http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0062593).

Put the name of your tests (one by one) in the search (you can also use the advanced search) and choose a paper that uses the test you selected. Read the relevant portions of the paper (the abstract, and then a search for occurrences of the test name may be sufficient!) and identify what are the Dependent Variables (DV), Independent Variables (IV), and, if applicable, control variables (remember class 1 slides if you forgot), how many they are, and what type they are (categorical, continuous...). 

Write out the number of DV, type of DV, number of IV, type of IV, number of control variables, kind of questions as a [table](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables) in your README.md file, filling in the same fields as in the first table in the ["When to use what test?" document](http://www.csun.edu/~amarenco/Fcs%20682/When%20to%20use%20what%20test.pdf). 

### GRADING: 

Your HW4\_\<netID\> README.md should should show, in addition to the usual items (the scope of the homework, the group partecipants, your role in the group work) the two-rows tables explaining the use of two tests.

## Assignment 3 Reproduce the NYC tests for the Hard to Employ programs:

Reproduce the analysis of the Hard to Employ programs for NYC. You should read the relevant portion f the study to make sure you are not just workign mechanically (Chapter 7 of the [original document](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2016_fb55/blob/master/HW4_fb55/effectivenes%20of%20NYC%20Post-Prison%20Employment%20Programs.ipynb).

Reproduce the results in cell 2 of Table 2.1 (Ever employed in a CEO transitional job), and cell 10 (Convicted of a felony). Fill in the cells of the scheleton notebook as you are asked to   

Follow the notebook in the HW directory (turn in the python notebook in the HW4_\<netID\> directory

## Grading 

All cells that are markes "for you to do" and that contain missing values should be filled.

The second null hypothesis should be stated.

Both tests, Z and Chisq, should be completed with the with the Convicted of a felony after 3 years data.

The effect of the statistic on the rejection of the Null should be stated in all cases.
